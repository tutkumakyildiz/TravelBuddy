# LocalTravelBuddy Project Rules

## Core Requirements

1. **Offline First**: This application should work offline. All functionality must be available without internet connectivity.

2. **AI Model**: This application will use Google Gemma 3n as the AI model (it's multimodal - supports text, image, and audio processing).

3. **Simple UI**: This application will be a 1-page UI with:
   - Maps integration
   - Microphone symbol (for voice input)
   - Camera symbol (for image capture)

4. **Map Service**: This app will use a map placeholder for MVP, with real maps to be added later.

5. **MVP Approach**: This is a Minimum Viable Product. Keep it simple and focus on core functionality only.

## Development Guidelines

- Prioritize offline functionality in all design decisions
- Minimize complexity - this is an MVP
- Ensure all features work without internet connection
- Focus on the essential: maps, voice, and camera integration
- Use map placeholder for MVP; add real maps when ready for development build
- Integrate Google Gemma 3n for AI processing
